## Routing Tool for Donations Pickup
Uses Google Maps API to optimize the order of stops in a route.

To use, prepare a csv file of addresses to upload. The first row of the file should be the column headings. The headings must include "name","address","apt", and "phone", all lowercase. Other fields are ok, but they will be ignored.
